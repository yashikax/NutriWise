        <h2>Diet, Mood, and Concentration</h2>
        <p>Did you know that your diet has a big impact on your mood, your concentration, and even your level of happiness?</p>
        <p>What you eat not only effects your physical health, but studies now show just how much diet impacts your mood and mental wellbeing. There's no single super-food that boosts mood - it's about having a varied, healthy diet. <br> A varied, healthy diet improves your memory, concentration and can even increase your level of optimism and protect you from depression. In contrast, eating too many highly processed, fried foods or sugary food and drinks has been shown to increase the likelihood of anxiety and increase the risk of developing depression.</p>

        <p>Itâ€™s not only what you eat, but also how you eat that makes a difference to your wellbeing.</p>

        <p>Food helps us connect with others, our community, our culture, and our land. Celebrating where your food comes from, how you prepare it, and who you share it with are wonderful ways to enjoy food, eat healthier, and boost your wellbeing:</p>

        <ul class="info">
            <li>Take the time to step away from the screen, sit down, and enjoy food wherever you can.</li>
            <li>Share a meal with a friend, family member, neighbor, or work colleague.</li>
            <li>Growing your own food can bring a great sense of satisfaction, make you feel more connected to your food, and help you to be active and feel more relaxed.</li>
